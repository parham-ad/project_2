#Stage 1 :Download the dataset with Python:

data = requests.get('https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/datasets/csv/weather/weather.csv')


#Stage 2 :Write data to a file in your system:
with open('weather.csv','wb') as csvfile :
    csvfile.write(data.content)

#ŸèStage 3 :Read data from saved file:
with open('weather.csv','r') as csvfile:
    data_reader = csv.DictReader(csvfile)
    data_reader_list = list(data_reader)

#Stage 4 :Calculate average of fields:

total_min_temp = 0
total_wind_direction = 0
total_wind_speed = 0
